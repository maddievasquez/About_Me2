CA1 for Mobile App module of semester 2

In this project the goal is to create an app that has:

- **A main screen that has:**

     - [ ] a pricture that is round without any previous cropping
     - [ ]  a small description of the student
     - [ ]  scrollview
    - [ ]  a titlebar
     - [ ] 4 buttons that takes us to the other activities: education, skills, hobbies and achievements the buttons should be the same size
  - [ ] Buttons must be 5pd apart from each other and not scroll when using the scrollview
   - [ ] The different activities buttons should only show the previous activity and the next activity
  - [ ] The first activity should have all four
  - [ ] The education activity should have the home button and the skills activity button

- **Copyright Text**
- [ ] has a small font size
- [ ] has dark gray color
- [ ] has a top padding 10dp with a top gray border of 1dp (to separate it out from the main content)
  

- **4 extra activities**
- [ ] title row is at the top of the app and does not scroll
- [ ] title row has a dark background (and hence white/light colored text and icon)
- [ ] button row is at the bottom of the app and does not scroll
button row spans full width of the app (i.e. each button's width will be set based on app's width)
- [ ] icon and title are displayed on top and in one row horizontally centered. - [ ] Contents inside this row should be vertically aligned in the centre (while the row itself is at the top of the page)


**Hard**
- [ ] Use at least one FrameLayout as a separator e.g. to separate two LinearLayouts or TextViews (Hint: Set height 1dp with a light gray background)
- [ ] Show both icons and text in buttons (except home icon)
- [ ] Make ImageView display your photo with rounded corners (without editing your photo)**
